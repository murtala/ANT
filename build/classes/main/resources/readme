***Purpose:
1. Put source files in the "src" folder
2. All generated files ==> to "build" folder
-- compiled files ==> "classes" folder
-- jar files ==> "jar" folder

*** Steps using Command Prompt
1. md build\classes  ==> create new directory
2. javac -sourcepath src -d build\classes src\main\java\ant\samples\HelloWorld.java  ==> compile the class
3. java -cp build\classes ant.samples.HelloWorld  ==> run the class
4. echo Main-Class: ant.samples.HelloWorld>myManifest  ==> Create a manifest file
5. md build\jar  ==> Create "jar" folder
6. "jar cfm build\jar\HelloWorld.jar myManifest -C build\classes\ant\samples ."  ==> Create the jar file
7. java -jar build\jar\HelloWorld.jar  ==> run the jar file




We want to separate the source from the generated files, so our java source files will be in src folder. 
All generated files should be under build
and there splitted into several subdirectories for the individual steps:classes for our compiled files and jar for our own JAR-file.
We have to create only the src directory
